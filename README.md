# Dishwasher Co-Unloader

This is the repository for the code to be implemented in the project for Assignment 2 of 41013 - Industrial Robotics, which comprises on the use of two robots in collaboration to manipulate everyday objects.
The ultimate goal is to unload a dishwasher and store these dishes on cupboards. All tasks are modelled using MATLAB software in conjunction with the Peter Corke's Toolbox modified by UTS.
Information about the robots used will be provided along with the files required to set them up.
